SINCE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO GATHER THE CUSTOMER REVIEW FROM OTHERS PLATFORM LIKE INSTAGRAM FACEBOOK GLASSDOOR AND AMBITIONBOX, BECAUSE OF THEIR ADVANCE SECURITY IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE 
TO SCRAP THE DATA SO I HAVE USED MY WEBAPP TO COLLECTS USER DATA WHERE USER CAN GIVE THEIR REVIEW AND BY USING TEXT BLOB THAT IS A PYTHON LIBRARY FOR TEXT PROCESSING I HAVE GOT THEIR
POLARITY AND SUBJECTIVITY AND FOR RATING PURPOSE I HAVE USED THESE POLARITY OF VARIOUS USERS TO CALCULATE THE AVS POLARITY AND SUBJECTIVITY , USERS CAN ALSO CHECK THE COMAPNY AVS POLARITY
AND SUBJECTIVITY ON THE RANGE OF -1 TO 1 IF THE POLARITY IS GREATER THAN 0 THEN COMPANY IS GETTING GOOD REVIEW OTHERWISE VISE VERSA.
NOW FOR SENDING MAIL I HAVE USED THREADING CONCEPT THE SENDMAIL APP WILL KEEP TRACK OF ANY CHANGES IN POLARITY AND IF THERE IS ANY IT WILL SEND A MAIL TO REGISTER USERS EVERY DAY.
